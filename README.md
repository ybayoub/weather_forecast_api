Prerequisite : You'll need to setup at least a Twilio and an OpenWeatherMap (OWM) accounts in order to access both of the services (free-tier as I did).

The aim of this code is to request from OWM some data about the next 48 hours in order to learn about how to deal with API Requests in a certain context.
